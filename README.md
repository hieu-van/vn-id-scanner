# ID Scanner

This app scans for and decodes data encoded in QR codes which are commonly found on government-issued IDs in Vietnam, such as Health Insurance, Identity Card, etc.

## Supported documents
* Health Insurance

## TODO
- [ ] Decode data on Identity Card. (If this was an issue, I would assign a _wontfix_ label to it... :P)
- [ ] Improve hospital name lookup database. Currently only several common hospitals in Hanoi exist in the database.
- [ ] Publish app on F-Droid.
- [x] Add an acceptable-looking icon :)
- [ ] Store hospital database in something other than in-line code, such as SQL.
